# Formula1_ML_Model

In this project i will be working on formula 1 dataset. I downloaded this dataset from kaggle. I will be analyzing about the circuits, driver_standings, pit_stops and many more. I will be using various visualizations, and I will also add some colums to get the insights from the data.

### Introduction
In this analysis we will observe how various columns in out dataset are related. We will also see what is the rank of the formula car according to the grid of the car that is how grid is related to the rank of formula car.

### Inferences and Conclusion
After importing the data, I started cleaning and preparing the data for the analysis process. I ran some code using pandas library to perform some steps like parsing dates, creating additional columns, merging multiple dataset etc... Then with the help of matplotlib and seaborn libraries I analyzed the data and made some visualizations to get insights from the data. Then by asking some questions I found the relationships between the columns. I also got to understand what story does the dataset want to tells us.

#### Observations
Here we can observe the formula car in the top grid completed it's race first.
The formula car with more points and less penalties is ranked 1st.
As the formula car in the top grid completed the race first, the formula car in the top grid also achieved the maximum points.
The are only 22 grids in the formula race.
Points that formula car gets also depends on the laps that formula car has made.
